## Hey!✌️

👨‍🎓 I'm a student (7th sem.) of Electrical and Information Technology at Hochschule Düsseldorf, specializing in Information Technology.
🔍 My fascination with IT is immense, and I'm eager to achieve success in this thrilling field.

🎓 My current goal? To successfully complete my bachelor's degree and embark on a career that feeds my curiosity and passion for innovative technologies.

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not studying or coding, you'll find me at the gym working on my fitness, or Sleeping .🍳

📚 I'm an avid reader of self-development books that inspire me to grow both personally and professionally.

🎮 During the colder months, I retreat into watching movies, with my Girlfriend – it's a great balance to my academic life.
